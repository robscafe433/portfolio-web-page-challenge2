# Portfolio second week challenge

## Portfolio mock web page


The motivation for this project was to practice the flex-box, using global variables in css,
and to have nav-link-anchor tags scroll to section upon click.

This solved the problem of alignment. First three uses of Flex-box i had children display: row, 
for the last use of Flex-box i used in media query and had display: column to better fit screen.

I learned how implementing the use of:

 Flex-box
 global css variables
 link attribute scrolling
 media queries
